# 2 Types of Routing in Web Apps

- Client Side Routing - Client-side routing is the same as server-side routing, but it's ran in the browser. Client-side routing has become more popular due to the popularity of creating single-page applications (SPAs).
- Server Side Routing - Server-side routing is the traditional way of routing. When a user navigates to a new page, the old page is discarded and the HTML of the new page is loaded. This requires the server to keep making requests to rerender the application.
